## Projects

### Simple Redundant Cloud Web Service

This project builds a geographically redundant, load-balanced pair of VM Linux-based web hosts running nginx,
using Terraform and Google Cloud Project. This is a quick way to scaffold up a web service for lower
environments and easy A/B testing by manipulating active hosts in the load balancer. This can also be
customized to use your other docker images or add additional cloud components.
